**PrimeFinder**
-
**Simple python3 program to find prime numbers within a range**
- Designate custom ranges or use default hard coded ranges.
- Store calculated prime numbers in text file.
- Cry with larger numbers, see "Limitations".

<br>

**Limitations**
- Performance drops as calculated number size increases.
    - For example, the program will find roughly 1 prime number every 3 seconds 
    when around 60,000,000 on an AMD Ryzen 1700x

**Anyway, if you find the code of any use, enjoy!**
