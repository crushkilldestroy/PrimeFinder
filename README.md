**PrimeFinder**
-
**Simple python3(.7.3) program to find prime numbers within a range**
- Designate custom ranges or use default hard coded ranges.
- Store calculated prime numbers in text file with unique naming scheme per range.
- Timer included.


- Cry with larger numbers, see "Limitations(1)".
    - Includes plenty of convoluted dirty code!

<br>

**Limitations**
- Performance drops as calculated number size increases.
    - For example, the program will find roughly 1 prime number every 3 seconds 
    when around 60,000,000 on an AMD Ryzen 1700x

**Anyway, if you find the code of any use, enjoy!**
